# IMPORTANT: Please only use two lines immediately below your name. Do not add lines. 
# Do not use more than two lines. Otherwise, you may cause merge conflicts with

# Mr. Fouasnon
assert home_for_the_holidays("Fouasnon") # since "Fouasnon" is between 5 and 13 letters long and "O" does not come before "F"
assert not brings_figgy_pudding(5, 8, 2, 0) # even though 0 quizzes means the student is in the holiday spirit, a 5th form with 8 demerits is not nice, and so does not bring figgy pudding

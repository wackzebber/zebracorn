# Task 0001: Upload your holiday ASCII art homework to GitHub

Because many students had issues submitting the `.py` file via Gmail or My
Groton, we are going to rely exclusively on GitHub.

Please name the file `holiday_ascii_art.py` and upload it to your GitHub
repository under `mgnozzio`. Please put it at the repo root, not in a
sub-folder. 

When you are done, the file should be accessible at a URL with the following
pattern:

```
https://github.com/mgnozzio/<your repo name>/blog/main/holiday_ascii_art.py
```
